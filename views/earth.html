        If you are reading this, you probably live here (or at least live just outside its atmosphere.) It is the third closest planet to the sun. It is within its starâ€™s habitable zone and is of a good size for supporting life. It also features large oceans and an atmosphere that are also good for supporting life. It has a single moon.
